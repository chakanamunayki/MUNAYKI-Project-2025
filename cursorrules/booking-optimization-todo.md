# Booking System Optimization Todo List

## 0. Authentication Flow Optimization (High Priority)
- [x] Modify the "Book Now" button to trigger authentication only
- [x] Create a simple loading page/component to show during authentication
- [x] Only load the booking form after successful authentication
- [x] Update the authentication flow to use a redirect pattern
- [x] Store the intended destination (booking form) in the session/localStorage
- [x] After successful auth, retrieve destination and redirect
- [x] Create a lightweight "AuthenticatingPage" component
- [x] Show clear loading indicators during the authentication process

## 1. Component Extraction and Structure
- [x] Extract `PersonalInfoStep` component to `src/components/booking/personal-info-step.tsx`
- [x] Extract `AdditionalParticipantsStep` component to `src/components/booking/additional-participants-step.tsx`
- [x] Extract `PaymentInfoStep` component to `src/components/booking/payment-info-step.tsx`
- [x] Create a `BookingContext` in `src/contexts/booking-context.tsx` to manage shared state
- [x] Create initial version of refactored form in `multi-booking-form-v2.tsx`
- [x] Complete refactoring of `multi-booking-form.tsx` to use the new components and context

## 2. Form Validation Improvements
- [ ] Implement react-hook-form for robust form validation
- [ ] Add inline validation feedback (replace alert() messages)
- [ ] Create reusable validation schemas for each step
- [ ] Add field-level error messages with proper styling

## 3. Database Integration and Error Handling
- [x] Implement the `insert_test_booking` SQL function for more robust database operations
- [ ] Add proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Implement transaction support for multi-step operations
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed API calls

## 4. User Experience Enhancements
- [ ] Improve loading states with better visual indicators
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for important actions
- [ ] Enhance mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Implement better progress saving between sessions

## 5. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Add unit tests for utility functions (pricing-calculator, currency-formatter)
- [ ] Add integration tests for the booking flow
- [ ] Implement end-to-end testing for critical user journeys
- [ ] Add accessibility testing and improvements

## 6. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Optimize state management to reduce unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Implement proper memoization for expensive calculations
- [ ] Optimize database queries and API calls
- [ ] Add proper loading and error states

## 7. Documentation
- [ ] Update component documentation
- [ ] Add inline code comments for complex logic
- [ ] Create a booking flow diagram
- [ ] Document the database schema and relationships

## Starting Point for Next Phase
1. ~~Begin with component extraction and structure~~ (Completed)
2. ~~Extract the PersonalInfoStep component first~~ (Completed)
3. ~~Create the BookingContext to manage shared state~~ (Completed)
4. ~~Extract the AdditionalParticipantsStep component~~ (Completed)
5. ~~Extract the PaymentInfoStep component next~~ (Completed)
6. ~~Complete the refactoring of the MultiBookingForm to use the new components~~ (Completed)
7. Test thoroughly before moving to the next phase

## Completed Work
1. Authentication Flow Optimization (March 2024)
   - Added loading indicators to "Book Now" buttons
   - Created AuthenticatingPage component for smooth authentication flow
   - Implemented LoadingOverlay component for visual feedback
   - Updated redirect patterns to preserve booking information
   - Improved user experience during authentication process

2. Component Extraction and Structure (March 2024)
   - Created PersonalInfoStep component for better code organization
   - Implemented BookingContext for centralized state management
   - Created initial version of refactored MultiBookingFormV2
   - Extracted AdditionalParticipantsStep component with BookingContext integration
   - Extracted PaymentInfoStep component with booking submission logic
   - Improved component reusability and maintainability
   - Completed refactoring of MultiBookingForm to use the new components and context

3. Database Integration (March 2024)
   - Implemented the `insert_test_booking` SQL function for more robust database operations
   - Updated PaymentInfoStep to use the BookingService with SQL function
   - Improved error handling and fallback to localStorage when database operations fail
   - Enhanced data validation before submission

## Notes on SQL Function
We already have an `insert_test_booking` SQL function that can be used for more robust database operations. This function:
- Takes a JSONB object with booking data
- Validates required fields
- Inserts the booking into the database
- Returns the inserted row or an error message

This function can be used to bypass TypeScript type issues in the client code and provide better error handling.
