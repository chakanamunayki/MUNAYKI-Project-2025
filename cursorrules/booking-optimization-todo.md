- [ ] Fix Next.js warnings about params.locale usage

## 7. Documentation
- [x] Update currency conversion documentation
- [ ] Add inline code comments for complex logic
- [ ] Create a booking flow diagram
- [ ] Document the database schema and relationships

## 8. Payment Process Enhancements
- [ ] Add more detailed payment instructions with specific bank account information

## Notes on SQL Function
We already have an `insert_test_booking` SQL function that can be used for more robust database operations. This function:
- Takes a JSONB object with booking data
- Validates required fields
- Inserts the booking into the database
- Returns the inserted row or an error message

This function can be used to bypass TypeScript type issues in the client code and provide better error handling. 

## Next.js Warnings to Fix
There are several warnings about `params.locale` usage that need to be fixed:
- Error: Route "/[locale]/booking/confirmation" used `params.locale`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties.
- Error: Route "/[locale]/experiences/ice-submersion" used `params.locale`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties.
- Error: Route "/[locale]/layout.tsx" used `params.locale`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties.

These warnings indicate that we need to update our code to properly await the params object before accessing its properties in server components.
