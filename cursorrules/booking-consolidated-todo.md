## Notes

### SQL Function
We already have an `insert_test_booking` SQL function that can be used for more robust database operations. This function:
- Takes a JSONB object with booking data
- Validates required fields
- Inserts the booking into the database
- Returns the inserted row or an error message

This function can be used to bypass TypeScript type issues in the client code and provide better error handling.

### Next.js Warnings to Fix
There are several warnings about `params.locale` usage that need to be fixed:
- Error: Route "/[locale]/booking/confirmation" used `params.locale`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties.
- Error: Route "/[locale]/experiences/ice-submersion" used `params.locale`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties.
- Error: Route "/[locale]/layout.tsx" used `params.locale`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties.

These warnings indicate that we need to update our code to properly await the params object before accessing its properties in server components.

### Dashboard Implementation Strategy
For the MVP dashboards, we'll focus on essential functionality first:
1. Create reusable dashboard layouts and components
2. Implement core data fetching from Supabase
3. Build basic CRUD operations for booking management
4. Focus on the most critical user journeys first
5. Ensure mobile responsiveness from the start
6. Implement proper authentication and authorization
